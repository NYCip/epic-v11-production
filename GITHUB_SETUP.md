# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Repository Creation

Since GitHub authentication is not currently set up on this system, here are the instructions to create and push to GitHub:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

**Option A: GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `epic-v11-multi-agent-ai-system`
3. Description: `🤖 EPIC V11 - Enterprise-grade Multi-Agent AI System with advanced security, real-time collaboration, and comprehensive monitoring. Features include secure authentication, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and end-to-end security implementation.`
4. Set to **Public** (unless you prefer private)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

**Option B: GitHub CLI (if authenticated)**
```bash
gh repo create epic-v11-multi-agent-ai-system \
  --description "🤖 EPIC V11 - Enterprise-grade Multi-Agent AI System with advanced security" \
  --public
```

### 2. Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the commands. Run these in the project directory:

```bash
# Add the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/epic-v11-multi-agent-ai-system.git

# Push the code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Repository Features to Enable

After pushing, configure these GitHub features:

**Security:**
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Enable security advisories
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Add topics: `security`, `fastapi`, `multi-agent`, `ai-system`, `enterprise`
- [ ] Set `README_SECURITY.md` as primary documentation

**Issues & Projects:**
